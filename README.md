Usage is described in more detail in the .ipynb.
In short, I recommend Google Colab: download /code/boltzmann_liquids.ipynb, upload the notebook to colab, and follow the instructions. Make sure in Colab that you are connected to a GPU and not a CPU-only runtime.
If you have an Nvidia GPU, you can run locally as well; just take the /code and /data contents, and place them all in the same directory. You may need to configure your system for CUDA (too system-dependent to offer instructions here).
